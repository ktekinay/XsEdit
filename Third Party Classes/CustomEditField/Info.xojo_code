		CustomEditField
		Well, here it is, a canvas-based, custom editfield.
		Enjoy.
		
		Known Issues: 
		• Linux has a problem positioning the caret, as I don't have a linux box, this issue is unlikely to be solved anytime soon.
		• A bug in RB2008r3.1 raises the keydown event twice for special chars entered using option + [key]
		• A bug? in 2008r5+ prevents the editfield to account for the vertical offset of the toolbar (if present), when the autocomplete suggestions window appera, will appear
		shifted up by the height of the toolbar. This is a Windows-only issue. To work around it, use the ShouldDisplaySuggestionWindowAtPos event and account for the vertical offset.
		
		Special Thanks to:
		Ryan Dary, Scott Fortmann-Roe, Dr Gerard Hammond, Roger Meier, Paul Rodman, Dave Sisemore, Bobby Skinner, Thomas Tempelmann, Seth Verrinder, Dave Wooldridge
		And to all of you out there who bought the source, reported bugs and made suggestions!

		********************************************************************************************************************************************** Global Settings:
		CEF_VERSION: the current version of the editfield, in case you need it...
		
		TextStorageType: determines the kind of structure used internally by the editfield to store text, the possible values are:
		
		STORAGE_MEMORYBLOCK = 0
		This is the fastest storage Method, uses a MemoryBlock to store the text... however, does NOT support multi-byte characters.
		Encodings: this method will re-encode the text to either macroman, or windowsansi.
		
		STORAGE_ARRAY = 1
		This is the slowest method, uses an array to store the characters in the text. This method supports utf8 and utf16 characters.
		Encodings: same as input, utf8 if nil.
		
		STORAGE_WIDEMEMORYBLOCK = 2
		This method is slower than STORAGE_MEMORYBLOCK but faster than STORAGE_ARRAY, it uses a *wide* memory block to store the text, 
		which means that it will use 4bytes per character, that is, it will use 4 times the memory that STORAGE_MEMORYBLOCK uses (2bytes per char in windows). It is however 
		noticeably faster than STORAGE_ARRAY, and supports utf characters.
		Encodings: UTF16... all text is stored as UTF16, and is returned as UTF16.
		
		UseOldRenderer:
		This Boolean value forces the field to draw its contents using QuickDraw instead of Quartz (this setting is only meaningful under OSX).
		setting this flag to true yields better performance, if you don't mind uglier results :)
		
		
		
		
		********************************************************************************************************************************************** CustomEditFieldPrinter
		This class allows you to easily print the contents of the editfield.
		To obtain a CustomEditFieldPrinter object, simply call CustomEditField.CustomEditFieldPrinter(g as Graphics) and pass the graphics context where you want to draw onto,
		you'll receive a fully configured CustomEditFieldPrinter object.
		
		This class has a single method:
		DrawBlock(x as integer, y as integer, width as integer, height as integer, lineRange as dataRange, wrap as boolean = false, lineNumbers as boolean = false) As integer
		
		it allows you to draw a "block" of text, to the specified rect (X,Y, Width, Height). You'll need to specify the range of lines to print, using a DataRange Object. Finally, 2 optional
		parameters, wrap, which defaults to false, sets word wrap on or off, and lineNumbers allows you to print the linenumber to the left of the printed line.
		
		It returns the last painted text line that was drawn into the specified rect, with this value, you can set a new print range, and call DrawBlock again.
		
		For more information, please look at the Demo project in DemoWindow.Print.
		
		
		
		
		********************************************************************************************************************************************** CustomEditField
		********************************************************************************************************************************************** Undo:
		The undo system has a global setting: CustomEditField.UNDO_EVT_BLOCK_SECS, you can set this to any value, and what it does is records 
		all actions of the same type up to this value in secods, all these actions will be undo/redo in a single step. If the action changes (from typing to deleting or the other way around)
		all the actions up to that point (under UNDO_EVT_BLOCK_SECS) are recorded in a single block.
		Setting it to 0 uses the original behavior (1 char at the time)
		
		
		
		
		********************************************************************************************************************************************** Block chars:
		There are 2 constants that define the characters that define a "block"
		BLOCK_OPEN_CHARS = "([{"
		BLOCK_CLOSE_CHARS = ")]}"
		
		you can add more chars to these constants to define your own blocks, as long as their positions in the constant string match, and as long as they're a single char.
		for example if you wanted '+' and '-' to define a block, modify the constants like so:
		BLOCK_OPEN_CHARS = "([{+"
		BLOCK_CLOSE_CHARS = ")]}-"
		
		
		
		
		********************************************************************************************************************************************** Events:
		AutocompleteOptionsForPrefix(prefix as string) as AutocompleteOptions
		Basically, you can use your own autocomplete engine here, prefix is the word for which you need to provide the autocomplete options.
		You need to set the following properties in the AutocompleteOptions object you wish to return:
		prefix as string: the word for which you will be providing the options.
		options() as string: the Autocomplete options for the prefix
		longestCommonPrefix as string: the longest common prefix of all the available options.
		The project includes an autocomplete engine based on a patricia tree, check the included demo project to see how it works.

	#tag Note, Name = 4. Syntax Definitions
		Quick and dirty guide on how to write a syntax definition.
		If you want, send me your definitions and I'll make them available on my website.
		
		Basic structure:
		<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
		    <!--
		        Version 1.0 are the files used by my previous SyntaxHighlightEditField, which are compatible with this EditField.
		        Version 1.1 adds some extensions, used by this editfield and are not understood by the previous one.
		    -->
		    <highlightDefinition version="1.1">
		
		    <!-- name for this definition, available as HighlightDefinitionInstance.name -->
		    <name>Definition Name</name>
		
		    <!--
		        Code Block definitions/line folding definitions
		        <blockStartMarker> defines the start of a code block, that can be folded, the attribute "indent" gives the number of indentations
		        that will be added to the a new line of text after the line that opens the block. for example, in the example below, the blockStartMarker
		        defines a C-style block:
		        {
		            and after hitting enter, all new lines below the opening line, will be indented "indent" times.
		        }
		        this example also defines a multi-line comment as a block:
		        /*
		        */
		    -->
		    <blockStartMarker indent="1">\{\s*(?:$|//|/\*)|\s*/\*</blockStartMarker>
		    <blockEndMarker>^\s*\}|\s*\*/</blockEndMarker>
		
		    <!--
		        Symbols
		        This block defines the symbols to bookmark by the editfield
		        In this Example, we define a "Class" and "Method" symbols.
		        These will be "bookmarked" and can be accessed using documentSymbols, CaretSymbol, or SymbolAtLine
		    -->
		    <symbols>
		        <symbol type="Class">
		                <entryRegEx>^[ \t]*((?:public|private|protected)?[ \t]*class[^{]+)</entryRegEx>
		        </symbol>
		        <symbol type="Method">
		                <entryRegEx>((?:public|private|protected)[ \t]+(?:(?:abstract|static|final|synchronized|native|strictfp)[ \t]+)*(?:[A-Za-z0-9_\-\.&lt;&gt;]+(?:\[\])?[ \t]+)?[A-Za-z0-9_\-]+[ \t]*\([^\)]*\)[ \t]*(?:\s*throws[ \t]*[A-Za-z0-9_\-, \t\.]+)?)\s*(?=\{?)</entryRegEx>
		        </symbol>
		    </symbols>
		    
		    <!--
		        Placeholders
		        This tag defines what text will be turned into a placeholder by the editfield.
		        In this Example, the text <#placeholder#> will turn into a round rect with the text "placeholder" in it.       
		        IMPORTANT: the RegEx contained here will be used to match the whole text needed to be turrned into placeholder, and the first subgroup will be used as the placeholder label. 
		    -->
		    <placeholders highlightColor="#000000" backgroundColor="#e9effa">&lt;#(.+?)#&gt;</placeholders>
		
		    <!-- Main document settings, defaultcolor is the color used by all text that is not highlighted -->
		    <contexts defaultColor="#0" caseSensitive="yes">
		
		    <!--
		        Highlight contexts, contexts are the main portion of the highlighter, they define the rules to find and highlight portions of text.
		        Name is an identifier for the context, highlight color is the color with which the context will be highlighted, this color overrides the color
		        of enclosing contexts.
		        Contexts can be nested, you can define any context within a context, this allows you to highlight portions of a context with different colors.
		
		        valid attributes for the highlightContext tag:
		        name: name of the context
		        highlightColor: color used to highlight words matched by the context #RRGGBB
		        backgroundColor: color to use as background for the matched words #RRGGBB
		        bold: true/false, should matched words be bolded? defaults to false
		        italic: true/false, should matched words be italic? defaults to false
		        underline: true/false, should matched words be underline? defaults to false
		
		        There are 4 different ways to define a context, all of which are exclusive, from top priority down they are:
		        <startRegEx>: it defines a possible multi-line context, everything starting with the regular expression <startRegex>
		        up to the regular expression <endRegex> will be highlighted.
		
		        <entryRegEx>: it defines a regular expression to match in a SINGLE line of text, if it's found, this context will be used.
		
		        <keywords>: defines a list of words to be highlighted, each regex has to be enclosed in <string></string> tags
		
		        <regexes>: defines a list or regular expressions that define the context, matching one of these uses this context for highlighting,
		        each regex has to be enclosed in <string></string> tags
		
		        in this example, XML tags are defined:
		    -->
		
		    <highlightContext name="Tags" highlightColor="#881280">
		        <entryRegEx>(&lt;[^&gt;]*&gt;)</entryRegEx>
		
		        <!-- Inner context, these highlight words within the enclosing context, in this case strings and attributes -->
		        <highlightContext name="Strings in Tags" highlightColor="#1A1AA6">
		            <entryRegEx>("[^"&gt;&lt;]*")</entryRegEx>
		        </highlightContext>
		
		        <highlightContext name="Single Strings in Tags" highlightColor="#1A1AA6">
		            <entryRegEx>('[^'&gt;&lt;]*')</entryRegEx>
		        </highlightContext>
		
		        <highlightContext name="Attributes in Tags" highlightColor="#994500">
		            <entryRegEx>([\w-]*)[ \t]*=(?=[ \t]*"[^"&gt;&lt;]*")</entryRegEx>
		        </highlightContext>
		    </highlightContext>
		
		    <!-- example: XML comments -->
		        <highlightContext name="Comment" highlightColor="#236E25">
		            <startRegEx>&lt;!--</startRegEx>
		            <endRegEx>--&gt;</endRegEx>
		            <highlightContext name="bolded" highlightColor="#FF0000" bold="true">
		                <keywords>
		                    <string>TODO</string>
